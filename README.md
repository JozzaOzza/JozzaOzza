- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JozzaOzza,
- I mostly do DevOps/Platform work
- But I also want to be able to program properly, and learn about computing more broadly
- Interested in building web applications, or machine learning algorithms
- C# is the language I know best, but want to improve my JavaScript (or TypeScript) and Python
